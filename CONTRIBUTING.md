- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Git
- Basic understanding of cryptography concepts

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vaultseed.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
5. Configure your `.env` file
6. Start development: `npm run dev:full`

- Ensure security review

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `security/description` - Security improvements
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(vault): resolve encryption key derivation issue
security(api): implement rate limiting
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Add/update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Run security checks
6. Submit pull request
7. Address review feedback

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Security tests
npm run test:security

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements
- All new features must have tests
- Maintain >90% code coverage
- Security-critical code requires extensive testing
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## üîí Security Review Process

### Security-Critical Changes
Changes affecting cryptography, authentication, or data handling require:
1. Security team review
2. Penetration testing
3. Code audit
4. Documentation update

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output encoding applied
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checked
- [ ] Cryptographic functions reviewed
- [ ] Error handling secure
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive data

## üìö Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Document complex algorithms

### Security Standards
- Use established cryptographic libraries
- Implement defense in depth
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling

### Code Style
```typescript
// Good
const encryptData = async (data: string, key: CryptoKey): Promise<string> => {
  try {
    const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: generateIV() },
      key,
      new TextEncoder().encode(data)
    );
    return arrayBufferToBase64(encrypted);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new SecurityError('Encryption failed', error);
  }
};

// Bad
function encrypt(d, k) {
  return crypto.encrypt(d, k); // No error handling, unclear types
}
```

## üìñ Documentation
